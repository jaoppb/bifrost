# SPDD Analysis

Analyze a requirement against the current codebase and produce a
**strategic-level** analysis. It adds domain concept identification, high-level
approach decisions and risk analysis to what the requirement already says, and
it is the input for `/spdd-reasons-canvas`. This phase covers the "what" and the
"why"; the "how" belongs to the REASONS Canvas.

**Input**: a GitHub issue. The issue body is the requirement. `@` file
references are reading material to analyse against, not requirement.

```text
/spdd-analysis #12
/spdd-analysis #14 @docs/notes.md
```

The analysis is written into the issue body under one `## Analysis` heading,
never into a file.

## Steps

0. **Resolve the work item (REQUIRED)**

   a. Extract the issue number from the input: `#12`, `GH-12`, or an issue URL.

   b. If no issue is found, ask the user: "Which GitHub issue does this work
   belong to? (number or URL)". Do NOT proceed without one. Never invent a
   number or use a placeholder.

   c. Verify it with `gh issue view <n> --json number,title,state,body`. Not
   found → stop and report. Closed → warn and ask whether to continue. The issue
   title and body are the requirement.

   d. **Taxonomy.** `AGENTS.md` section 7 requires exactly one `type:` label, at
   least one `area:` label and one milestone (and a parent, epics excepted).
   Check them with `gh issue view <n> --json labels,milestone`. Warn, naming the
   missing field, and ask whether to continue.

   e. **Exemption.** `AGENTS.md` section 5: spikes (the `type:spike` label) are
   exempt from SPDD. Say so and ask whether to continue anyway; never refuse.

   **Size gate** (`AGENTS.md` section 5, and section 7 for Effort). `AGENTS.md`
   section 5: an issue with Effort 5 or more follows SPDD, and its analysis is
   the gate (no code before the analysis exists). An issue below Effort 5 has no
   SPDD artifacts. Effort is read at triage, and the analysis may raise it. Read
   the size: find the Project titled "Bifrost" with
   `gh project list --owner jaoppb --format json`, then
   `gh project item-list <number> --owner jaoppb --limit 1000 --format json`,
   and take the Effort of the item for `<n>`; a missing `project` scope is fixed
   with `gh auth refresh -s project`. If the size is below the threshold, is not
   set, or cannot be read, stop with one short message that says which case
   applies (together with the exemption question when both apply), and ask
   "Continue anyway?". Never refuse and never print a token. On yes, continue;
   on no, stop and change nothing.

   **Board.** Starting the analysis moves the card to In progress by hand
   (`just project-sync` never does that).

1. **Read the requirement**

   a. The requirement (the issue body) is the only source of requirements. If
   the input adds requirement text that it does not hold, say so and ask the
   user to add it to the requirement first. Never put that text into the
   analysis instead.

   b. If the input contains `@` file or folder references, read ALL of them
   completely (every relevant file in a folder). If any cannot be read, report
   it and ask for an alternative.

   c. Check that the requirement has a goal, a scope and a Definition of Done.
   If not, ask the user to complete it first.

2. **Concept-driven codebase exploration**

   Do NOT read the whole codebase. Build a lightweight fingerprint, extract
   search concepts from the requirement, then explore only the relevant parts in
   depth.

   a. **Project fingerprint (always first, fast)**:
   - Read `AGENTS.md` (the rules)
   - Read the root `Cargo.toml` (workspace members, `[workspace.dependencies]`,
     `[workspace.lints]`)
   - Read `arch-lint.toml` (scopes and the `core-stays-platform-independent`
     deny list) and `clippy.toml` (thresholds)
   - Read `justfile` (the recipes) and `tools.toml` (the issue workflow)
   - List `crates/` and `tools/` (directory names only) to see which modules
     exist

   b. **Extract search concepts** from the requirement:
   - Domain nouns: "clipboard entry", "paired device", "notification", "file
     transfer"
   - Action verbs: "sync the clipboard", "pair a device", "mirror a
     notification", "send a file"
   - Integration surfaces: Tailscale, Wayland and Hyprland, D-Bus, the Android,
     macOS and Windows adapters
   - Technical hints: "peer-to-peer", "wire protocol", "conflict", "offline
     peer"

   These concepts are the search scope for everything that follows.

   c. **Targeted code exploration**:
   - Search for types, interfaces and modules that match the concepts (e.g.
     `fn product_name`, `mod tests`, the `restrict-use` rules in
     `arch-lint.toml`)
   - Read the matched files to learn the existing invariants, error types,
     boundaries and adapters
   - Follow direct dependencies **one hop** (read the interface a use case takes
     and its implementations, but don't keep chaining)
   - Note which module owns each concept and which shared types already exist
     for reuse
   - Observe conventions in use (naming, error types, test doubles, test names)
   - If no matching code exists, say so explicitly and rely on `AGENTS.md`

   d. **Controlled expansion (one extra hop only)**: if steps b–c reveal a
   concept that is clearly essential but was not extracted, add it and do
   **one** more targeted search. Stop there and note the boundary.

   If the scope turns out very large (10+ existing modules), list all concepts,
   prioritise the core ones, and mark the rest as "boundary context" to verify
   during the REASONS Canvas.

3. **Domain Concept Identification**: conceptual level only, with no attributes,
   types or signatures.

   ```text
   ### Domain Concept Identification

   #### Existing Concepts (from codebase)
   - [ConceptName]: [business purpose] — [where it lives] — [relations]

   #### New Concepts Required
   - [ConceptName]: [business purpose] — [how it relates to existing concepts]

   #### Key Business Rules
   - [Rule, explicit or implicit]: [which concepts it governs]
   ```

4. **Strategic Approach & Trade-offs**: direction, not specifics (no queries,
   payload shapes, signatures or step-by-step logic).

   - The overall approach, the existing patterns to reuse, and the general data
     flow (e.g. "platform adapter reports a clipboard change → `bifrost-core`
     sync engine → transport over Tailscale → peer daemon → peer platform
     adapter")
   - The key decisions: their trade-offs, the recommendation and why

   ```text
   ### Strategic Approach

   #### Solution Direction
   - [High-level description of approach]

   #### Key Design Decisions
   - [Decision]: [trade-offs] → [recommendation and rationale]

   #### Alternatives Considered
   - [Alternative]: [why rejected]
   ```

5. **Risk & Gap Analysis**: surface everything that needs clarifying before
   detailed design. List only the gaps; never restate the Definition of Done.

   ```text
   ### Risk & Gap Analysis

   #### Requirement Ambiguities
   - [Ambiguity]: [what needs clarification]

   #### Edge Cases
   - [Scenario]: [why it matters]

   #### Technical Risks
   - [Risk]: [potential impact and mitigation direction]

   #### Definition of Done Gaps
   - [Item or scope line]: [what the Definition of Done does not check]
   ```

6. **Assemble** `## Analysis` with the three `###` sections above, in that
   order. The exploration in step 2 is a working process: its findings show up
   as file paths and conventions inside the sections, never as a separate
   "codebase context" section. Never paste what the requirement already says.

7. **Write the section**

   `## Analysis` is always the last section, and nothing above it is ever
   changed.

   a. Write the body through a temporary file, never an inline string:
   `gh issue edit <n> --body-file <file>`.

   b. **No `## Analysis` yet**: append it after the existing text, with one
   blank line between them.

   c. **`## Analysis` already there**: show the user the `###` entries you would
   add, change or drop, each with a one-line reason. Edit only those and keep
   the others word for word. After the user confirms, read the live body again
   (`gh issue view <n> --json body`). If it has changed since you read it, stop
   and tell the user. Never write over someone else's edit.

   Then show a summary: the work item, the modules involved, the counts of
   existing concepts, new concepts, key decisions, Definition of Done gaps and
   open risks, and the next step `/spdd-reasons-canvas #<n>`.

8. **Offer the next phase**: "The analysis is ready. Proceed with
   `/spdd-reasons-canvas #<n>`?"

## Markdown output

Everything this skill writes must pass `just fmt-check`. Every fenced block has
a language (`text`, `mermaid`). Use real headings, never bold lines. Put blank
lines around headings, lists and fences.

## Guardrails

- Do NOT proceed without a resolved work item; never use a placeholder
- Do NOT proceed when the size gate stopped and the user did not confirm
- Do NOT skip codebase exploration, and do NOT read the whole codebase: scope by
  concepts
- Do NOT assume structure without reading the actual files
- Do NOT paste what the requirement already says (requirement, scope, Definition
  of Done)
- Use Bifrost's vocabulary: crates, `bifrost-core` (platform independent), the
  daemon `bifrostd`, per-OS adapters, repository tools, value objects, errors
  per module boundary
- Do NOT include implementation detail (queries, payload shapes, signatures,
  attributes, step-by-step logic); that belongs to `/spdd-reasons-canvas`
- Do NOT generate code or modify any file in the codebase, and never change the
  issue body above `## Analysis`
- Do NOT leave placeholders or TODOs
- Definition of Done gaps MUST be listed, and only the gaps; ambiguities MUST be
  surfaced, never silently assumed
- Read ALL `@` references completely, never truncated; report any that fail

## Where this fits

`/spdd-analysis` (what and why) → `/spdd-reasons-canvas` (how) →
`/spdd-generate` (code) → `/spdd-prompt-update` (keep the canvas and the code in
step).

| Concern | `/spdd-analysis` | `/spdd-reasons-canvas` |
|---------|------------------|------------------------|
| Thinking level | Strategic: what and why | Tactical: how |
| Domain | Conceptual identification | Detailed entity modelling (E) |
| Solution | Direction and trade-offs | Concrete design (A, S) |
| Implementation | Out of scope | Ordered operations (O) |
| Standards | Out of scope | Norms and safeguards (N, S) |
| Risks | Identify and surface | Resolve through constraints |
